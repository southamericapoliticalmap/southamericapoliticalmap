<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p> The Middle East is a region steeped in history, culture, and religion. It is the birthplace of three major world religions &#8211; Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The region has been the center of numerous conflicts throughout history, and its borders have shifted over time. One of the most significant periods in the region&#8217;s history is the time of Jesus, which is the focus of this article. In this article, we will explore the Middle East map at the time of Jesus and how it has changed over the years. </p>
<h2>The Middle East Map at the Time of Jesus</h2>
<p> The Middle East at the time of Jesus was a vast region that included modern-day Israel, Palestine, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Iran, and parts of Turkey and Egypt. It was under the control of the Roman Empire, which had conquered the region in 63 BC. The Roman Empire had divided the region into several provinces, including Judea, Samaria, Galilee, and Perea. </p>
<h3>The Province of Judea</h3>
<p> Judea was the southernmost province and was the home of Jerusalem, the center of Jewish worship. It was also the birthplace of Jesus. The province was ruled by a Roman procurator who was responsible for maintaining law and order in the region. The procurator was assisted by a Jewish council called the Sanhedrin. </p>
<h3>The Province of Samaria</h3>
<p> Samaria was located between Judea and Galilee. It was the home of the Samaritans, a group of people who practiced a form of Judaism that was distinct from that of the Jews in Judea. The Samaritans and Jews had a long history of conflict, and there was a deep-seated animosity between them. </p>
<h3>The Province of Galilee</h3>
<p> Galilee was located in the north of the region and was the home of Jesus. It was a fertile region that was known for its agriculture, fishing, and trade. The people of Galilee were a mix of Jews and Gentiles, and the region was known for its religious and cultural diversity. </p>
<h3>The Province of Perea</h3>
<p> Perea was located on the east bank of the Jordan River and was the home of several Jewish communities. It was a semi-autonomous region that was under the control of a Jewish prince. </p>
<h2>The Changes to the Middle East Map</h2>
<p> Over the centuries, the Middle East map has changed significantly. The Roman Empire fell in the 5th century AD, and the region was subsequently conquered by various empires, including the Byzantine Empire, the Arab Empire, and the Ottoman Empire. The borders of the region have shifted many times, and new countries have emerged, including Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq. </p>
<h3>The Creation of Israel</h3>
<p> One of the most significant changes to the Middle East map was the creation of Israel in 1948. Israel was established as a homeland for the Jewish people, who had been persecuted throughout history, including during the Holocaust. The creation of Israel was a controversial move that was opposed by many Arab countries, and it has been the source of numerous conflicts in the region. </p>
<h3>The Syrian Civil War</h3>
<p> In recent years, the Middle East region has been rocked by the Syrian civil war, which began in 2011. The conflict has caused significant changes to the map of the region, with many areas being controlled by different factions and groups. The war has caused a humanitarian crisis, with millions of people being displaced from their homes. </p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p> The Middle East map at the time of Jesus was a vast region that was under the control of the Roman Empire. The region has changed significantly over the centuries, with new countries and borders emerging. The region has been the center of numerous conflicts throughout history, and it continues to be a volatile region to this day. Understanding the Middle East map at the time of Jesus is an important part of understanding the history and culture of the region. </p></article>

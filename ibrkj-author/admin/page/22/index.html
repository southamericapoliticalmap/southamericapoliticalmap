<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p> Java is a popular programming language that is widely used in developing various applications. One of the most commonly used data structures in Java is the Map interface, which allows us to store and manipulate key-value pairs. In this article, we will discuss how to create a Map in Map example in Java. </p>
<h2>What is a Map in Java?</h2>
<p> A Map is an interface in Java that represents a mapping between a key and a value. It is similar to a dictionary in Python or an object in JavaScript. The Map interface is implemented by several classes in Java such as HashMap, TreeMap, and LinkedHashMap. </p>
<h2>How to Create a Map in Java?</h2>
<p> To create a Map in Java, we can use any of the classes that implement the Map interface. Let&#8217;s take the example of a HashMap. </p>
<pre><code> Map<string integer> map = new HashMap<>(); </string></code></pre>
<p> In the above code, we have created a HashMap that stores key-value pairs where the key is of type String and the value is of type Integer. </p>
<h2>How to Add Values to a Map in Java?</h2>
<p> To add values to a Map in Java, we can use the put() method. Let&#8217;s see an example. </p>
<pre><code> map.put("John", 30); map.put("Jane", 25); </code></pre>
<p> In the above code, we have added two key-value pairs to the HashMap. The key &#8220;John&#8221; has a value of 30 and the key &#8220;Jane&#8221; has a value of 25. </p>
<h2>How to Retrieve Values from a Map in Java?</h2>
<p> To retrieve values from a Map in Java, we can use the get() method. Let&#8217;s see an example. </p>
<pre><code> int age = map.get("John"); System.out.println("John's age is " + age); </code></pre>
<p> In the above code, we have retrieved the value associated with the key &#8220;John&#8221; and stored it in the variable age. We have then printed the age using the System.out.println() method. </p>
<h2>What is a Map in Map in Java?</h2>
<p> A Map in Map is a data structure that allows us to store a Map as the value of another Map. Let&#8217;s take an example. </p>
<pre><code> Map<string map integer>> mapInMap = new HashMap<>(); Map<string integer> johnMap = new HashMap<>(); johnMap.put("Maths", 90); johnMap.put("Science", 85); mapInMap.put("John", johnMap); Map<string integer> janeMap = new HashMap<>(); janeMap.put("Maths", 95); janeMap.put("Science", 80); mapInMap.put("Jane", janeMap); </string></string></string></code></pre>
<p> In the above code, we have created a Map in Map where the key is of type String and the value is of type Map<string integer>. We have then added two key-value pairs to the Map in Map where the key is the name of the student and the value is another Map that stores the subject and the marks. </string></p>
<h2>How to Retrieve Values from a Map in Map in Java?</h2>
<p> To retrieve values from a Map in Map in Java, we can use the get() method twice. Let&#8217;s see an example. </p>
<pre><code> int mathsMarks = mapInMap.get("John").get("Maths"); System.out.println("John's Maths marks are " + mathsMarks); </code></pre>
<p> In the above code, we have retrieved the value associated with the key &#8220;John&#8221; from the Map in Map. We have then retrieved the value associated with the key &#8220;Maths&#8221; from the Map that is stored as the value of &#8220;John&#8221; in the Map in Map. We have then printed the maths marks using the System.out.println() method. </p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p> In this article, we discussed how to create a Map in Map example in Java. We also learned how to add values to a Map, retrieve values from a Map, and retrieve values from a Map in Map. Maps are an important data structure in Java and are widely used in various applications. </p></article>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>On September 19, 1985, Mexico City was hit by a devastating earthquake. Almost 40 years later, the city is still at risk of suffering from seismic activity due to its location on the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. In this article, we will provide an updated map of Mexico City&#8217;s earthquake zones and share tips on how to stay safe in case of an earthquake.</p>
<h2>The Mexico City Earthquake Map</h2>
<p>The Mexico City Earthquake Map is divided into four seismic zones: A, B, C, and D. Zone A is the most vulnerable to earthquakes, while Zone D is the least vulnerable. The map is regularly updated by the National Seismological Service (SSN) and can be accessed on their website.</p>
<h3>Zone A</h3>
<p>Zone A covers the central and southern parts of Mexico City and includes the neighborhoods of Roma, Condesa, and Del Valle. This area is the most vulnerable to earthquakes due to its soft soil, which amplifies the seismic waves. Buildings in this area are required to follow strict construction codes to withstand earthquakes.</p>
<h3>Zone B</h3>
<p>Zone B covers the western and northern parts of the city, including the neighborhoods of Santa Fe and Polanco. This area is less vulnerable to earthquakes than Zone A, but buildings must still follow construction codes. </p>
<h3>Zone C</h3>
<p>Zone C covers the eastern part of the city, including the neighborhoods of Iztapalapa and Nezahualcoyotl. This area is less vulnerable to earthquakes than Zones A and B, but buildings must still follow construction codes.</p>
<h3>Zone D</h3>
<p>Zone D covers the outskirts of the city, including the neighborhoods of Tlalpan and Milpa Alta. This area is the least vulnerable to earthquakes, but buildings must still follow construction codes.</p>
<h2>Tips for Staying Safe During an Earthquake</h2>
<p>Even if you live in a less vulnerable seismic zone, it is important to know how to stay safe during an earthquake. Here are some tips:</p>
<h3>Prepare an Emergency Kit</h3>
<p>Make sure you have an emergency kit prepared with food, water, and medical supplies. Keep the kit in a place that is easy to access.</p>
<h3>Identify Safe Spaces</h3>
<p>Identify safe spaces in your home, workplace, and school. These spaces should be away from windows, mirrors, and objects that could fall.</p>
<h3>Practice Drills</h3>
<p>Practice earthquake drills with your family, coworkers, and classmates. This will help you know what to do in case of an earthquake.</p>
<h3>Stay Calm</h3>
<p>If an earthquake happens, stay calm and remember to drop, cover, and hold on. Drop to the ground, take cover under a table or desk, and hold on until the shaking stops.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Living in Mexico City means being prepared for earthquakes. By knowing the seismic zones, staying informed about earthquake risks, and being prepared for emergencies, you can help keep yourself and your loved ones safe. Remember to always stay calm during an earthquake and follow the recommended safety measures.</p>

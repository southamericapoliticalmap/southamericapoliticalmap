<h2>The Origin of Narmada River</h2>
<p>Narmada River, also known as the “Life Line of Madhya Pradesh”, is one of the seven holy rivers of India. It originates from Amarkantak in Madhya Pradesh and flows through Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Madhya Pradesh before emptying into the Arabian Sea. The river is 1,312 km long and has a drainage area of over 98,000 square km.</p>
<h2>The Importance of Narmada River</h2>
<p>The Narmada River has a significant role in the political, economic, and social structure of India. The river is a major source of water for irrigation, drinking, and industrial purposes. It also provides hydroelectric power and supports the fisheries industry.</p>
<p>The river is considered holy by Hindus, and many pilgrimage sites are located along its banks. The Narmada Parikrama, a pilgrimage of over 2,600 km around the river, is considered one of the most important pilgrimages in India.</p>
<h2>The Political Significance of Narmada River</h2>
<p>The Narmada River has played a significant role in the politics of India. The Narmada Bachao Andolan (Save Narmada Movement) was a social movement that began in the 1980s to protest the construction of dams on the river. The movement gained national attention and resulted in the cancellation of some dam projects.</p>
<p>The Narmada Control Authority, established in 1980, manages the water resources of the Narmada River. The authority is responsible for the planning, development, and management of the Narmada River Basin. The authority comprises representatives from the states through which the river flows and the central government.</p>
<h2>The Future of Narmada River</h2>
<p>The Narmada River faces many challenges, including pollution, deforestation, and climate change. The government has taken steps to address these challenges, such as the Narmada Seva Yatra, a campaign to clean and conserve the river.</p>
<p>The government has also proposed several projects to harness the potential of the river, such as the Narmada Dam Project and the Narmada Valley Development Project. These projects aim to provide water for irrigation, drinking, and industrial purposes and generate hydroelectric power.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Narmada River has a significant role in the political, economic, and social structure of India. The river is a major source of water and power and supports the fisheries industry. It is also considered holy by Hindus and has many pilgrimage sites along its banks. The Narmada River faces many challenges, but the government has taken steps to address them and harness the potential of the river.</p>

Clear IAS" width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;"><figcaption>IndiaChina Border Disputes What is the Doklam Issue? Clear IAS from www.clearias.com</figcaption></figure>
<h2>The Historical Background</h2>
<p>India and China have a long-standing history of being the most populous countries in the world. The two nations have had a complex relationship for centuries that has seen them engage in territorial disputes and political tensions. The border dispute between India and China has been a major issue for decades, and the two countries have been trying to resolve it through diplomatic channels.</p>
<h2>The Current Scenario</h2>
<p>The India-China border dispute is an ongoing conflict that has been the cause of several military confrontations over the years. The two countries share a 3,488 km-long border, which is known as the Line of Actual Control (LAC). The LAC is not demarcated, and both India and China have different perceptions of it.</p>
<h3>The Map Controversy</h3>
<p>The India-China border dispute has been a bone of contention between the two nations for many years. The main issue is the demarcation of the border, which has not been mutually agreed upon by both countries. The Chinese government has released its own map of the border, which is different from India&#8217;s official map. This has led to a lot of confusion and tensions between the two nations.</p>
<h2>The Impact on India</h2>
<p>The India-China border dispute has had a significant impact on India&#8217;s economy and security. The disputed areas are strategically important, and their ownership is crucial for India&#8217;s national security interests. The border dispute has also affected India&#8217;s relations with other countries in the region.</p>
<h3>The Importance of the Himalayas</h3>
<p>The Himalayan range plays a crucial role in the India-China border dispute. The area is rich in natural resources and is strategically important for both countries. The Himalayas also act as a natural barrier between India and China, making it difficult for both countries to engage in military operations.</p>
<h2>The Way Forward</h2>
<p>The India-China border dispute is a complex issue that requires a diplomatic resolution. Both countries need to engage in meaningful dialogue and find a mutually acceptable solution. The two countries have made some progress in recent years, but there is still a long way to go.</p>
<h3>The Role of International Organizations</h3>
<p>The international community has a crucial role to play in resolving the India-China border dispute. Organizations like the United Nations can act as mediators and facilitate talks between the two countries. The involvement of international organizations can help create a conducive environment for resolving the dispute.</p>
<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>The India-China border dispute is a long-standing issue that needs to be resolved for the benefit of both countries. A peaceful resolution of the dispute will not only benefit India and China but also the entire region. Both countries need to show restraint and work towards a mutually acceptable solution.</p>
<h3>The Importance of Bilateral Relations</h3>
<p>The India-China border dispute should not be allowed to overshadow the broader bilateral relations between the two countries. India and China have a lot to gain from a healthy and constructive relationship. Both countries need to focus on building trust and confidence in each other to move forward.</p>
<h2>The Road Ahead</h2>
<p>The India-China border dispute is a complex issue that requires a long-term solution. The two countries need to engage in sustained dialogue to find a resolution. The resolution of the border dispute will not only benefit India and China but also promote peace and stability in the entire region.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p> Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code tool that simplifies the process of managing and provisioning cloud-based resources. One of its key features is the ability to use maps, which are data structures that allow you to associate keys with values. In this article, we will explore the concept of maps in Terraform and how they can be used to improve your infrastructure automation. </p>
<h2>What are Maps?</h2>
<p> In Terraform, maps are a type of data structure that allow you to store key-value pairs. They are similar to dictionaries in other programming languages. Maps are defined using curly braces and colons. For example, the following code defines a map with two key-value pairs: </p>
<pre> variable "my_map" { type = map default = { "key1" ="value1" "key2" ="value2" } } </pre>
<h2>Using Maps in Terraform</h2>
<p> Maps can be used in Terraform for a variety of purposes, such as defining variables, creating resources, and configuring modules. One common use case for maps is to define variables that are used to configure resources. For example, you can define a map that specifies the configuration for an EC2 instance: </p>
<pre> variable "ec2_config" { type = map default = { "ami" ="ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0" "instance_type" ="t2.micro" "subnet_id" ="subnet-12345678" "security_group_ids" = ["sg-12345678"] } } resource "aws_instance" "example" { ami = var.ec2_config["ami"] instance_type = var.ec2_config["instance_type"] subnet_id = var.ec2_config["subnet_id"] vpc_security_group_ids = var.ec2_config["security_group_ids"] } </pre>
<h2>Working with Maps in Terraform</h2>
<p> Maps in Terraform can be manipulated using various built-in functions. For example, the keys and values functions can be used to extract the keys and values from a map: </p>
<pre> locals { my_map = { "key1" ="value1" "key2" ="value2" } } output "keys" { value = keys(local.my_map) } output "values" { value = values(local.my_map) } </pre>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p> Maps are an essential feature of Terraform that can help you simplify your infrastructure automation. By using maps, you can define variables, configure resources, and manipulate data with ease. With the examples and tips provided in this article, you should now be well-equipped to start using maps in your own Terraform projects. </p></article>

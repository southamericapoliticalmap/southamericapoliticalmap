<h2>The Birth of the Republic of Texas</h2>
<p>In 1836, Texas declared its independence from Mexico after a bloody war that lasted for a year. The victory at the Battle of San Jacinto on April 21, 1836, marked the end of the conflict, and Texas became an independent republic.</p>
<h2>The Map of Texas in 1836</h2>
<p>The map of Texas in 1836 was significantly different from what we see today. The republic had an area of approximately 389,000 square miles, which included parts of present-day Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming, and New Mexico. The map was drawn to show the boundaries of the new republic and its neighboring states and territories.</p>
<h3>The Boundaries of the Republic</h3>
<p>The eastern boundary of the Republic of Texas was the Sabine River, which separated it from Louisiana. The southern boundary was the Rio Grande, which separated it from Mexico. The western boundary was the 103rd meridian, which is now the boundary between Texas and New Mexico. The northern boundary was the Red River, which separated it from Indian Territory, now Oklahoma.</p>
<h3>The Capitals of the Republic</h3>
<p>The Republic of Texas had two capital cities during its brief existence. In 1836, the capital was located in the town of Washington-on-the-Brazos. Later that year, it was moved to Houston, which remained the capital until 1839 when it was moved to Austin.</p>
<h2>The Legacy of the Map</h2>
<p>The map of Texas in 1836 is a historical artifact that tells the story of the birth of a new nation. It represents the struggles and triumphs of the Texan people who fought for their independence. The map also serves as a reminder of the challenges that the republic faced, including the threat of annexation by the United States.</p>
<h3>The Importance of History</h3>
<p>Studying history is essential for understanding the present and shaping the future. The map of Texas in 1836 is a prime example of how historical artifacts can provide insight into the past and help us make better decisions in the future.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The map of Texas in 1836 is a fascinating piece of history that tells the story of the birth of the Republic of Texas. It serves as a reminder of the struggles and triumphs of the Texan people and the challenges that they faced in their fight for independence. By studying history, we can gain a better understanding of the present and make better decisions for the future.</p>

<h2> The Consequences </h2>

It also had an impact on the global economy, with energy prices skyrocketing due to the disruption of gas supplies from Russia. </p>
<p> The Ukraine invasion also had a significant impact on global politics, with many countries reevaluating their relationship with Russia. Sanctions were imposed on Russia, which had a major impact on its economy. The conflict also highlighted the importance of international cooperation and the need for countries to work together to resolve conflicts peacefully. </p>
<h2> Conclusion </h2>

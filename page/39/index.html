<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p> Java is a widely used programming language that has many features to offer. One of the most important features of Java is its ability to handle collections of data efficiently. Java provides a framework for handling collections, including maps, which are a type of collection that allows you to store data in key-value pairs. One common task when working with maps is to traverse them to access and manipulate their contents. In this article, we&#8217;ll explore how to traverse maps using iterators in Java. </p>
<h2>What are Iterators?</h2>
<p> An iterator is an object that allows you to traverse a collection of elements one by one. In Java, the Iterator interface provides methods for accessing and manipulating the elements of a collection. When you use an iterator, you can access each element in the collection without knowing the underlying data structure of the collection. </p>
<h2>What are Maps?</h2>
<p> A map is a collection of key-value pairs. In Java, the Map interface provides methods for storing and retrieving data in a map. Maps are commonly used to store data in a way that allows for quick and efficient lookups based on a key value. </p>
<h2>Traversing Maps using Iterators</h2>
<p> To traverse a map using an iterator, you first need to get an iterator object. You can get an iterator object for a map using the entrySet() method of the Map interface. The entrySet() method returns a Set of Map.Entry objects, which represent the key-value pairs in the map. Once you have an iterator object, you can use the hasNext() method to check if there are more elements in the map. The next() method can then be used to retrieve the next key-value pair in the map. You can access the key and value of each pair using the getKey() and getValue() methods of the Map.Entry interface. </p>
<h2>Example Code</h2>
<p> Let&#8217;s take a look at an example of how to traverse a map using an iterator. </p>
<pre> Map<string integer> map = new HashMap<>(); map.put("John", 25); map.put("Jane", 30); map.put("Bob", 35); Iterator<map.entry integer>> iterator = map.entrySet().iterator(); while (iterator.hasNext()) { Map.Entry<string integer> entry = iterator.next(); String key = entry.getKey(); int value = entry.getValue(); System.out.println(key + " : " + value); } </string></map.entry></string></pre>
<p> In this example, we first create a HashMap and add some key-value pairs to it. We then get an iterator object for the map using the entrySet() method. We use a while loop to iterate through the map using the iterator. Inside the loop, we get the next key-value pair using the next() method and access the key and value using the getKey() and getValue() methods. We then print out the key and value to the console. </p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p> Traversing maps using iterators is an important task when working with maps in Java. By using iterators, you can access and manipulate the elements of a map efficiently without knowing the underlying data structure of the map. In this article, we&#8217;ve explored how to traverse maps using iterators in Java. By using the example code provided, you can start working with maps and iterators in your own Java programs. </p></article>

<h2>The Historical Significance of the Map</h2>
<p> The map of NC counties in 1790 is a fascinating piece of history that provides a glimpse into the past. It was created during a time when North Carolina was still a young and growing state, and it clearly shows the layout of the counties at that time. The map is important for historians and genealogists because it can help them trace the origins of families and communities in North Carolina. </p>
<h3>The Creation of the Map</h3>
<p> The map was created by Joseph Purcell, an Englishman who settled in North Carolina in the 1780s. Purcell was a surveyor and cartographer who had a keen interest in mapping the growing state. He spent several years traveling throughout North Carolina, surveying the land and creating detailed maps of the counties. </p>
<h3>The Counties on the Map</h3>
<p> The map of NC counties in 1790 shows a total of 69 counties, which is significantly more than the 100 counties that make up North Carolina today. Some of the counties on the map no longer exist, while others have been split into multiple counties over time. Some of the counties on the map include Brunswick, Carteret, Chatham, Craven, Cumberland, and Duplin. </p>
<h2>The Changes Over Time</h2>
<p> Over time, the counties on the map of NC in 1790 have undergone significant changes. Some counties have been merged with others, while others have been split into multiple counties. For example, the original county of Dobbs was split into several counties, including Lenoir, Greene, and Wayne. The county of Tryon was also split into several counties, including Rutherford, Lincoln, and Cleveland. </p>
<h3>The Impact on Genealogy and History</h3>
<p> The changes to the counties over time have had a significant impact on genealogy and history. It can be difficult to trace the origins of families and communities when the counties have changed so much. However, the map of NC counties in 1790 provides an important starting point for genealogists and historians who are interested in tracing the history of North Carolina. </p>
<h2>The Importance of Preserving History</h2>

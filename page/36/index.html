<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Earthquakes are one of the most devastating natural disasters that can strike at any time, without warning. The National Capital Region (NCR) is one of the most populous regions in the Philippines, and as such, it is important to understand the risks associated with earthquakes.

<h2>Understanding the Risks</h2>

<h3>2. Developing an Emergency Plan</h3>
<p>Make a plan with your family or roommates about what to do in case of an earthquake. Identify safe areas in your home or workplace, and determine a meeting place in case you are separated. Practice your plan regularly.</p>
<h3>3. Securing Your Home</h3>
<p>Secure heavy furniture and appliances to the wall to prevent them from falling during an earthquake. Make sure that your home is up to building code standards and that any necessary repairs have been made.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>

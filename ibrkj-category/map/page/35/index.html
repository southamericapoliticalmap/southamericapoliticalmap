<h2>Why 1890?</h2>

The Kingdom of Italy was established in 1861, and by 1890, Italy had become a major European power. This was a crucial time for the country, and the map of Italy was constantly evolving.</p>
<h2>The Regions of Italy in 1890</h2>
<p>In 1890, Italy was divided into 69 regions. These regions were grouped into three main categories: Northern Italy, Central Italy, and Southern Italy. Each region had its own unique culture, traditions, and dialects. Some of the most notable regions included:</p>
<h3>Northern Italy</h3>
<p>The Northern region of Italy was known for its industrialization and wealth. Some of the most important regions in Northern Italy included Lombardy, Piedmont, and Veneto.

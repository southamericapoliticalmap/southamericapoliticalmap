<h2>Tips for Using MapQuest</h2>
<p> &#8211; Double-check your starting and ending points before you click on the &#8220;Reverse Directions&#8221; button. &#8211; Use the zoom function to get a closer look at your route. &#8211; Take note of any landmarks or notable locations along the way to help you stay on track. &#8211; If you&#8217;re using the MapQuest app, make sure to enable location services so that the app can track your current location. </p>
